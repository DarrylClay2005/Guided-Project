NOTE TO WHOEVER REVIEWS THIS CODE: Visual Code Studio is not committing changes to the commits on github! I don't know why! Please ignore the commit history!


A Hour Later It's working but Is there any reason that visual code just sometimes chooses not to commit my changes?

To whoever is grading this if you could shed some light on this problem i would be grateful for your assistance.
